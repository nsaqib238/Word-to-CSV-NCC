The Australian Building Codes Board(ABCB), on behalf of the Australian Government and each State and Territory government, produces and maintains the NCC.When determining the content of the NCC, the ABCB seeks to—  • ensure requirements have a rigorously tested rationale; and  • effectively and proportionally address applicable issues; and  • create benefits to society that outweigh costs; and  • consider non-regulatory alternatives; and  • consider the competitive effects of regulation; and  • not be unnecessarily restrictive.  The primary users of the NCC include architects, builders, plumbers, building surveyors, hydraulic consultants, engineers and other building and plumbing related professions and trades.  Format of the NCC  The NCC is published in three volumes.The Building Code of Australia(BCA) is Volumes One and Two of the NCC and the Plumbing Code of Australia(PCA) is Volume Three of the NCC.  Components of the NCC  The NCC provides the technical provisions for the design and construction of buildings and other structures, and plumbing and drainage systems.  NCC Volume One primarily covers the design and construction of multi-residential, commercial, industrial and public assembly buildings and some associated structures.  NCC Volume Two primarily covers the design and construction of smaller scale buildings including houses, small sheds, carports and some associated structures.  NCC Volume Three covers the design, construction and maintenance of plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing buildings.  Each volume contains—  • Governing Requirements; and  • Performance Requirements; and  • compliance options to meet the NCC requirements; and  • State and Territory variations and additions.","VIC Part E4                    Stormwater - Surface and sub-surface drainage systems	327  Schedule 1                     Definitions 	329  Schedule 2                     Referenced documents 	331  VIC                                  Footnote: Other legislation affecting buildings 	337  Schedule 11     Western Australia  WA                                  Introduction 	339  Schedule 1                     Definitions 	340  Schedule 2                     Referenced documents 	341  WA                                  Footnote: Other legislation affecting buildings 	342  Introduction to the National Construction Code(NCC)  About the NCC  The NCC is Australia’s primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings.As a performance-based code, it sets the minimum required level for the safety, health, amenity, accessibility and sustainability of certain buildings.It primarily applies to the design and construction of new buildings, and plumbing and drainage systems in new and existing buildings.In some cases it may also apply to structures associated with buildings and new building work or new plumbing and drainage work in existing buildings.

Explanatory Information  Explanatory information and Introduction information contained in the NCC is non-mandatory and is provided for guidance purposes only. This informative material should be read in conjunction with the technical provisions of the NCC. Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.  Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.  Generally, a reference to a building is a reference to the whole building, regardless of classification. However, when a  provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.  Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the designation ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, ‘Class 9b’ refers only to Class 9b buildings, but ‘Class 9’ refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.  Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the relevant provisions for its classification.  A number of the Performance Requirements of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate to”. These expressions provide flexibility by allowing appropriate authorities to determine the degree of compliance necessary in a particular case. Therefore, any part of the NCC that uses these expressions should be referenced against the requirements of the appropriate authority. For example, an appropriate authority might judge that an item need not be installed, or a particular level of performance be achieved.  Application, Limitation, and Exemption statements are used to identify provisions that may or may not apply in certain situations, to varying degrees.  Figures are used to explain the requirements of a particular clause. To ensure the context of the requirement is clearly understood, adjacent construction elements of the building that would normally be required in that particular situation are not always shown. Accordingly, aspects of figures that are not shown should not be interpreted as meaning these construction details are not required. Therefore a figure must not be used as an indication of the full construction requirements in a given situation, as the only available option, or a substitute for referencing appropriate construction requirements (in other sources) for a given clause.  Introduction to this Part  This Part explains the possible methods of demonstrating compliance with the NCC.It explains the various compliance pathways within the NCC and the appropriate steps that must be taken for each of these pathways.","TAS A1G4(7)  Notes  For Volume Three, if a word is not defined in Schedule 1, the meaning (if any) attributed to it under AS/NZS 3500.0 should be used unless the contrary intention appears.

Some exceptions to this classification include: certain bed and breakfast accommodation, boarding houses, guest houses, hostels, or lodging houses and the like which fall within the concession provided for Class 1b buildings.  Also, any sized building can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if it is used to house any number of unrelated people who jointly own or rent it, or share it on a non-rental basis with an owner or tenant.

Class 9c buildings are residential care buildings that may contain residents who have various care level needs.  The Class 9c classification recognises that many residents progress through a continuum of care needs from low to high. Many older people enter residential care with low care needs (typically Class 3 facilities) but, as they age, require higher levels of care. In the past, such progression often necessitated the transfer of a hostel resident (Class 3) to a nursing home (Class 9a). This frequently had negative consequences for the health and well-being of the resident, for whom the hostel accommodation was home. It also led, at times, to the separation of couples with differing care needs. Building designers should note that Class 3 buildings include hostels for the accommodation of the aged, and Class 9a buildings include nursing homes. It is important to be aware, however, that construction of Class 3 or 9a buildings may restrict the options available to the operators of a facility in relation to the profile of the residents they wish to accommodate. Where the potential exists for residents of varying care needs to be accommodated, consideration of the Class 9c provisions may be appropriate. The Class 9c classification allows for any mix of low and high care residents and is intended to allow the mix to change as the residents’ care needs change over time, without the need to obtain any further consent or approval from the appropriate authority.  Multi-care level facilities are for residents who may require the full range of care services outlined by the Aged Care Act. Hence, it is not intended to restrict the resident type and provides maximum flexibility for service providers, residents and the community.  The NCC provisions for Class 9c buildings are based on minimal on duty on-site staff being available at any time. However, it is recognised that the staff numbers vary throughout the course of any one day, due to the care needs of the residents and the functioning of the facility. It is also recognised that the specific care needs of the residents may result in a greater minimum number of staff.","Regarding the Exemption to A6G10(2)(b), a building could be a mixture of Class 9b and another class, or a Class 9b building could contain parts that are of another class, but be taken as a Class 9b building because of Exemption (1) to A6G1.  Class 9c buildings are residential care buildings that may contain residents who have various care level needs.  The Class 9c classification recognises that many residents progress through a continuum of care needs from low to high. Many older people enter residential care with low care needs (typically Class 3 facilities) but, as they age, require higher levels of care. In the past, such progression often necessitated the transfer of a hostel resident (Class 3) to a nursing home (Class 9a). This frequently had negative consequences for the health and well-being of the resident, for whom the hostel accommodation was home. It also led, at times, to the separation of couples with differing care needs.

However identification of low fire load, low occupant risk and low risk of fire spread should not be used as justification for choosing a less stringent building classification for a building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions. For example, if the intended use of a building is to grow or store a large amount of tomatoes, such as a large greenhouse, and there is likely to be only one to two persons in the building at any time, it is considered inappropriate to classify the building as a Class 10a under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions and a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would be more appropriate.  The Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for a Class 7 or Class 8 farm building or farm shed do not prevent the ability to consider or develop a Performance Solution for a particular building where the requirements may not be considered appropriate or are viewed as too stringent. Similarly if a Class 7 or 8 building used for farming purposes does not meet all the criteria to be considered a farm building or farm shed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, this would not limit the ability to develop a Performance Solution which could contain features similar to those allowed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for farm buildings or farm sheds.  For example, if a Class 8 commercial poultry building meets all the criteria to be considered a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions other than the maximum floor area criteria, a Performance Solution could be developed to demonstrate that the concessions for a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are appropriate.  In regards to a farm building or farm shed where the purpose of the building is to park farm vehicles when not in use, as well as perhaps clean or polish the vehicle(s), it may be appropriate that this type of building is classified as a Class 7a.  However, a number of farm buildings and farm sheds are often not only used for the storage of farm vehicles, but to store supplies such as fuel, grain or hay. A Class 7a classification may still be appropriate where the majority of the shed’s space is intended to be designated for the parking of vehicles. However, it may be more appropriate to classify some types of buildings as Class 7b, rather than Class 7a where a mixed use shed is intended.  UnderA6G12each part of a building (including the entire building) may have more than one classification. This means, for example, that it is permissible to classify part of a building as a Class 6/7 building, or a Class 5/6 building, or whatever is appropriate.  It is expected that this approach may be taken by a builder who is uncertain of what the precise use of a building will be after its sale, or to maximise the flexibility of the building’s use.","Similarly if people are likely to be employed to pack or process materials/produce within a building, or employed to feed, clean or collect produce from animals or plants within a building then a classification of Class 8 may be appropriate.

Similarly if a Class 7 or 8 building used for farming purposes does not meet all the criteria to be considered a farm building or farm shed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, this would not limit the ability to develop a Performance Solution which could contain features similar to those allowed under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions for farm buildings or farm sheds.  For example, if a Class 8 commercial poultry building meets all the criteria to be considered a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions other than the maximum floor area criteria, a Performance Solution could be developed to demonstrate that the concessions for a farm building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions are appropriate.  In regards to a farm building or farm shed where the purpose of the building is to park farm vehicles when not in use, as well as perhaps clean or polish the vehicle(s), it may be appropriate that this type of building is classified as a Class 7a.  However, a number of farm buildings and farm sheds are often not only used for the storage of farm vehicles, but to store supplies such as fuel, grain or hay. A Class 7a classification may still be appropriate where the majority of the shed’s space is intended to be designated for the parking of vehicles. However, it may be more appropriate to classify some types of buildings as Class 7b, rather than Class 7a where a mixed use shed is intended.  UnderA6G12each part of a building (including the entire building) may have more than one classification. This means, for example, that it is permissible to classify part of a building as a Class 6/7 building, or a Class 5/6 building, or whatever is appropriate.  It is expected that this approach may be taken by a builder who is uncertain of what the precise use of a building will be after its sale, or to maximise the flexibility of the building’s use.","",false,false,"","","","","","","","","","","","","",DTS,NORMATIVE,ALWAYS,"",Similarly if people are likely to be employed to pack or process materials/produce within a building,"Similarly if people are likely to be employed to pack or process materials/produce within a building, or employed to feed, clean or collect produce from animals or plants within a building then a classification of Class 8 may be appropriate. Depending upon whether the criteria in the definition of farm shed or farm building have been met, the associated Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions in NCC Volume One Part I3 may apply.  However identification of low fire load, low occupant risk and low risk of fire spread should not be used as justification for choosing a less stringent building classification for a building under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions. For example, if the intended use of a building is to grow or store a large amount of tomatoes, such as a large greenhouse, and there is likely to be only one to two persons in the building at any time, it is considered inappropriate to classify the building as a Class 10a under the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions and a classification of Class 7 or Class 8 would be more appropriate.

Explanatory Information  It is not unusual for authorities to receive plans proposing the connecting of two or more buildings. Connecting buildings could be achieved by breaking openings through walls, or by joining the buildings by a tunnel, bridge or covered walkway. When connected, if the buildings jointly comply with all the requirements of the NCC applying as if they were a single building, they become a united building.  United buildings are not required to comply with additional NCC provisions. For example, any new openings do not require any form of fire protection not required of a single building.  Note, however, an external wall, which as a result of an interconnection becomes an internal wall, must comply with the requirements for an internal wall.  Interconnected buildings that do not jointly comply with all the requirements applicable to a single building, remain as separate buildings.  This raises the possible need for fire doors, or other forms of protection to be fitted to connecting openings.  Explanatory Information: Multiple allotments or ownership  The NCC does not concern itself with actually prohibiting or permitting the uniting of buildings in separate ownership or on separate allotments. Such matters are dealt with by the relevant local bodies.  Explanatory Information: Example of connection by bridge  In this example, Building A is connected to Building B by bridge C. There are four different options for designing such a proposal.  The first is a united building:  A, B and C are considered as a single structure and comply with the NCC.  The second is three separate buildings:  A, B and C are a fire-source feature to each of the others, and are separated by fire walls with the openings protected at the points of connection. In this case, C may require independent support and separate egress to a road or open space, that is not through Buildings A or B. In this case, attention should also be paid to the length of the bridge, as regards distance of travel to an exit.  The third option is the bridge as a portion of Building A:  In this option, A and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. B is a separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire-doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be supported off Building A, but not off Building B.  The fourth option is having the bridge as a portion of Building B:  In this option, B and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. A is a separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be supported off Building B, but not off Building A.  In some cases, C will link A and B across a public road, including laneways and the like. Special approvals may be required from various appropriate authorities. However, in such cases—  •   if C is supported by means other than off A and B, such support will generally only be permitted if there is no obstruction of the public road; and  •   care will need to be taken in calculating the distance of travel to an exit if travel is required to be over C and the road is wide; and  •   fire-separation may be necessary at each end of the bridge.  If the last stipulation is the case, the following matters need consideration:  •   The bridge would probably need to be of fire-rated construction because combustible construction could provide a ready path for the transfer of fire, and non-combustible construction could, in a major fire, distort and collapse onto the road.  •   The designer needs to take care that the bridge does not negate the fire separation between the storeys of the building.","If, after alterationsor any other building work, two or more of the buildings in A7G1 cease to be connected through openings in the dividing walls, each of those buildings not now connected must comply with all the requirements for a single building.

(2) The BCIIP Act legislates additional requirements for those building contractors undertaking Commonwealth funded building work through the Building Code 2016, regulated by theABCC, and the Work Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme(WHS Accreditation Scheme), administered by the OFSC.Of direct relevance to the NCC: Provisions in BCIIP Act include a requirement that the Federal Safety Commissioner audits building contractors’ compliance with the NCC in relation to building materials, which is a condition of accreditation under the WHS Accreditation Scheme.  (3) The Australian Government has committed to abolish the ABCC and the Building Code 2016.To achieve this, the Government has introduced the Fair Work Legislation Amendment(Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022(the Bill) which would repeal provisions of the BCIIP Act that provide for the ABCC and the Building Code 2016.The Bill would also retain provisions of the BCIIP Act that provide for the OFSC and the WHS Accreditation Scheme in a renamed Act, the Federal Safety Commissioner Act 2022.Builders undertaking Commonwealth-funded building work would still be required to comply with the NCC.  Introduction  Footnote: Other legislation affecting water and plumbing systems  ACT Introduction  The Australian Capital Territory Appendix to the Plumbing Code of Australia(PCA) forms part of the ACT Plumbing Code in accordance with the Water and Sewerage Act 2000.The ACT Appendix contains variations and additions to the PCA that apply to plumbing and drainage work undertaken in the ACT and information about the application of the PCA in the ACT.The ACT Appendix is notified on the ACT Legislation Register and can be found at https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2000-68/ under the Regulations and Instruments tab.  While some ACT-specific clauses are flagged in the text of the PCA, others may not be.Users of the PCA should confirm they are using the version of the ACT Appendix currently in force and are applying all relevant variations and additions.Historical versions of the ACT Appendix are also available on the register.  ACT Footnote: Other legislation affecting water and plumbing systems  In addition to any applicable provisions of the Building Act 2004 and this Code, there are other legislative technical requirements affecting the design, construction and/or performance of buildings that practitioners may need to be aware of.A list of relevant legislation and links to where it can be found on the ACT Legislation Register can be found in the ACT Appendix at https://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2004-11/ under the Regulations and Instruments tab.

Introduction to this Part  This Part sets out the requirements for any part of an on-site wastewater management systemfrom the point of connection of a sanitary drainage system up to and including the appropriate means of waste disposal.  In New South Wales On-site wastewater management systems are not the responsibility of the plumbing regulator.  For sewerage management facilities which treat sewerage of a domestic nature from premises occupied by a maximum of 10 persons or where the average daily flow of sewerage is less than 2000 litres, the facility must be accredited by the NSW Ministry of Health in accordance with Local Government(General) Regulation 2005.  Information on on-site single domestic wastewater management and accreditation guidelines can be found on the following website: https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/domesticwastewater  For land application areas the regulatory authority for land application systems is the local government(Council) and most local governments have a sewerage management strategy or policy.A list of NSW local governments may be found here;  https://www.olg.nsw.gov.au/public/local-government-directory  Aisle: A walkway at the end of rows of seating, not being continental seating, leading to a cross-over or to an egress doorway.  Appropriate authority  The relevant authority with the responsibility to determine the particular matter.  Assembly building  A building where people may assemble for—  (a) civic, theatrical, social, political or religious purposes including a library, theatre, public hall or place of worship; or  (b) educational purposes in a school, early childhood centre, preschool, or the like; or  (c) entertainment, recreational or sporting purposes including—  (i) a cinema; or  (ii) a sports stadium, sporting or other club; or  (d) transit purposes including a bus station, railway station, airport or ferry terminal.  Auditorium: A part of an entertainment venue used or intended to be used for the purposes of accommodating an audience to an entertainment.  Continental seating: Rows of seating in which the rows extend the full width of an auditoriumwithout intervening aisles.  Cross-over: In relation to an entertainment venue or temporary structure, means a walkway between aisles or between an aisle and an egress doorway.  Designated bushfire prone area  Land that:  (a) has been designated under legislation; or  (b) has been identified under an environmental planning instrument, development control plan or in the course of processing and determining a development application,  as land that can support a bushfire or is likely to be subject to bushfire attack.  Development consent: Is as defined in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.  Entertainment venue: Is as defined in the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2021.  Film: A cinematograph film of a size of 35 mm or greater.  Flying scenery: Scenery of a kind that is lifted above the stage floor by means of lines run from a grid.  Garage top dwelling: A Class 1a dwelling located above a Class 10a private garage which is not associated with that Class 1a dwelling and includes any internal entry stair serving the garage top dwelling.  Grid: A framework from which lines are run for the purpose of lifting flying scenery above the stage floor.  Information and education facility: Is as defined in the Standard Instrument—Principal Local Environment Plan.  Licensed premises: Is as defined in the Liquor Act 2007.  Minimum lateral clearance: A permanently unobstructed space having a height above floor level of not less than 2000 mm and a width of not less than the specified measurement.

(14) All openings to tanks must be sealed so that insects, small animals, birds and sunlight cannot enter tanks, in order to minimise the growth of algae and to prevent unauthorised access.  (15) Before using the water from a tank for the first time the tank must be cleaned and disinfected(See Appendix I of AS/NZS 3500.1).  (16) The manufacturer’s warranty must contain the following statement: “This tank has been manufactured for the storage of drinking water and all materials used are suitable for contact with drinking water.”  Explanatory Information  Information on some of the above items listed in the materials above may be obtainable from the manufacturer or supplier of the product or materials.  Rainwater for drinking purposes should not be collected from recently painted roofs (until after the first few rainfalls), timber roofs preserved with chemicals, roofs coated with lead flashings, lead-based paints or tar-based coatings, or parts of roofs near flues from solid fuel heaters. Rainwater for drinking water purposes may be collected from roof types other than those identified above provided the roof and associated gutters are kept clean of leaves, animal remains, dust and other debris. Gutters must be kept clean by installing screens or leaf diverters between the roof and the water tank. The system should incorporate a ‘first flush system’ or other diversion system that will prevent the first flush of water from entering the tank.  Tanks should be regularly maintained by cleaning out accumulated sludge from the base every 2 - 3 years. For detailed advice on desludging and maintaining tanks refer to the enHealth Guide – Guidance on the use of rainwater tanks; or HB 230 Rainwater tank design and installation handbook  For ongoing maintenance of water quality one or more of the following water quality treatment methods should be adopted: Chlorinating: To commission the tank sufficient chlorine should be added to provide a free chlorine residual of 0.5 mg/L after 30 minutes. To satisfy chlorinating requirements an initial dose of 5 mg/L of chlorine may be necessary. For every kL of water in the tank, add either: 40 mL of liquid pol chlorine (sodium hypochlorite - 12.5% available chlorine); or 8 grams of granular pool chlorine (calcium hypochlorite - 65% available chlorine). To calculate the tank volume in kL for a cylindrical tank the volume in of water in kL = D x D x H x 0.785. Where D = diameter of the tank, and H = depth of water in the tank in metres. To verify this calculation, compare this volume with the maximum capacity of the tank. The chlorine residual may be tested with a swimming pool test kit or dip strips. Water after chlorinating should not be used for 24 hours to enable any harmful microorganisms to be killed off. Filtration: If filters are used in drinking water installations they are to be certified to the relevant Australian Standard under the WaterMark Certification Scheme and should be maintained by following the manufacturer’s maintenance instructions. Ultraviolet Disinfection: Filtration may be required to address water turbidity to enable adequate UV disinfection. Ultraviolet treatment is affected by the levels of turbidity, organic content from suspended solids, pH, hardness and UV transmissivity of the water. The intensity of the UV light and the build-up of suspended solids on the quartz tube affect the disinfection performance. Regular monitoring of the quartz tubes is critical. Lamps also need to be replaced regularly in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.","(7) Stainless steel sheet must be manufactured from alloy 304 or 316 complying with ASTM A240/A240M.
