Explanatory Information  Explanatory information and Introduction information contained in the NCC is non-mandatory and is provided for guidance purposes only. This informative material should be read in conjunction with the technical provisions of the NCC. Any statements made in the informative and guidance components of the NCC should not be taken to override the NCC. Unlike the NCC, which is adopted by legislation, the informative and guidance components are not called up into legislation and they do not cover State and Territory variations and additions. Because informative and guidance components of the NCC do not have regulatory force, the ABCB accepts no responsibility for its contents when applied to specific buildings or any liability which may result from its use.  Defined words provide the precise meaning and expressions of key words used for understanding and complying with the NCC. Where a word is not defined in the NCC, the relevant common meaning of the word should be used.  Generally, a reference to a building is a reference to the whole building, regardless of classification. However, when a  provision is applicable to a specific class or classes of building, that reference to a building may be a reference to the whole building or part of the building depending on how the building is classified.  Classes 1a and 1b, 7a and 7b, 9a, 9b and 9c, and 10a, 10b and 10c are separate classifications. In the NCC, when the designation ‘a’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ is not applied, the reference is to all buildings of the general class. For example, ‘Class 9b’ refers only to Class 9b buildings, but ‘Class 9’ refers to Classes 9a, 9b and 9c.  Whether a provision applies or not depends on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances in which the reference is made. For example, where a building has a single classification, a reference to a building in the NCC is understandably a reference to a whole building. However, where a building has parts of different classification, unless the contrary intention appears (i.e. there is a specific reference to the whole building), a reference to a building in the NCC is a reference to the relevant part of the building. This means that each part of the building must comply with the relevant provisions for its classification.  A number of the Performance Requirements of the NCC use the expression “to the degree necessary” or “appropriate to”. These expressions provide flexibility by allowing appropriate authorities to determine the degree of compliance necessary in a particular case. Therefore, any part of the NCC that uses these expressions should be referenced against the requirements of the appropriate authority. For example, an appropriate authority might judge that an item need not be installed, or a particular level of performance be achieved.  Application, Limitation, and Exemption statements are used to identify provisions that may or may not apply in certain situations, to varying degrees.  Figures are used to explain the requirements of a particular clause. To ensure the context of the requirement is clearly understood, adjacent construction elements of the building that would normally be required in that particular situation are not always shown. Accordingly, aspects of figures that are not shown should not be interpreted as meaning these construction details are not required. Therefore a figure must not be used as an indication of the full construction requirements in a given situation, as the only available option, or a substitute for referencing appropriate construction requirements (in other sources) for a given clause.

Class 9c buildings are residential care buildings that may contain residents who have various care level needs.  The Class 9c classification recognises that many residents progress through a continuum of care needs from low to high. Many older people enter residential care with low care needs (typically Class 3 facilities) but, as they age, require higher levels of care. In the past, such progression often necessitated the transfer of a hostel resident (Class 3) to a nursing home (Class 9a).

It is important to be aware, however, that construction of Class 3 or 9a buildings may restrict the options available to the operators of a facility in relation to the profile of the residents they wish to accommodate.

Multi-care level facilities are for residents who may require the full range of care services outlined by the Aged Care Act. Hence, it is not intended to restrict the resident type and provides maximum flexibility for service providers, residents and the community.  The NCC provisions for Class 9c buildings are based on minimal on duty on-site staff being available at any time.

A Class 9b building is an assembly building which is defined to include a building where people may assemble for entertainment, recreational or sporting purposes.","","","","","","","",A6G12,"","","","","","","","","","",V2,"","","","","","","","","",A,A6,true

Connecting buildings could be achieved by breaking openings through walls, or by joining the buildings by a tunnel, bridge or covered walkway. When connected, if the buildings jointly comply with all the requirements of the NCC applying as if they were a single building, they become a united building.  United buildings are not required to comply with additional NCC provisions. For example, any new openings do not require any form of fire protection not required of a single building.

Interconnected buildings that do not jointly comply with all the requirements applicable to a single building, remain as separate buildings.  This raises the possible need for fire doors, or other forms of protection to be fitted to connecting openings.  Explanatory Information: Multiple allotments or ownership  The NCC does not concern itself with actually prohibiting or permitting the uniting of buildings in separate ownership or on separate allotments.

There are four different options for designing such a proposal.  The first is a united building:  A, B and C are considered as a single structure and comply with the NCC.  The second is three separate buildings:  A, B and C are a fire-source feature to each of the others, and are separated by fire walls with the openings protected at the points of connection. In this case, C may require independent support and separate egress to a road or open space, that is not through Buildings A or B. In this case, attention should also be paid to the length of the bridge, as regards distance of travel to an exit.  The third option is the bridge as a portion of Building A:  In this option, A and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. B is a separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire-doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be supported off Building A, but not off Building B.  The fourth option is having the bridge as a portion of Building B:  In this option, B and C are one building, meeting all requirements of the NCC as a single or united building. A is a separate building, with suitable fire separation, including fire doors at the point of interconnection. Bridge C could be supported off Building B, but not off Building A.

However, in such cases—  •   if C is supported by means other than off A and B, such support will generally only be permitted if there is no obstruction of the public road; and  •   care will need to be taken in calculating the distance of travel to an exit if travel is required to be over C and the road is wide; and  •   fire-separation may be necessary at each end of the bridge.  If the last stipulation is the case, the following matters need consideration:  •   The bridge would probably need to be of fire-rated construction because combustible construction could provide a ready path for the transfer of fire, and non-combustible construction could, in a major fire, distort and collapse onto the road.  •   The designer needs to take care that the bridge does not negate the fire separation between the storeys of the building.","If, after alterationsor any other building work, two or more of the buildings in A7G1 cease to be connected through openings in the dividing walls, each of those buildings not now connected must comply with all the requirements for a single building.

Explanatory Information: Different smoke alarm requirements for Class 1a and Class 1b buildings  Part 9.5 of the ABCB Housing Provisions specifies different smoke alarm requirements for Class 1a and Class 1b buildings.The main difference is that a Class 1b building is required to have a greater number of smoke alarms, i.e.smoke alarms must be installed in all bedrooms, and a system of lighting must be installed to assist evacuation.This is due to Class 1b buildings generally being used for more transient purposes and the occupants being less familiar with the building layout.  Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms complying with AS 3786  Clause 9.5.1(b) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires a smoke alarm(s) to comply with AS 3786.AS 3786 contains the requirements for the design and performance of electrically operated smoke alarms containing both detection and alarm facilities.Types of smoke alarms prescribed in AS 3786 include photoelectric, ionisation or a combination of the two.  Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms to be connected to consumer mains source  Clause 9.5.1(c) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires that a smoke alarm be connected to the consumer mains electricity source where a consumer mains source is supplied to the building.A smoke alarm complying with AS 3786, that is intended for connection to an external power source, is required to be provided with a secondary power source i.e.a source of power to supply the smoke alarm in the event that the primary power source is unavailable.Generally, the requirement is met by providing mains powered smoke alarms with a battery back-up.  Explanatory Information: Interconnection of smoke alarms  Clause 9.5.1(d) of the ABCB Housing Provisions requires that alarms be interconnected to provide a common alarm so that if one alarm in the dwelling activates, the other alarms automatically activate, which will increase the likelihood of sleeping occupants becoming aware of the detection of smoke.Alarms of a Class 1 building need not be interconnected with alarms in another Class 1 building or a private garagewhich does not belong to the Class 1 building.  Explanatory Information: Location of smoke alarms  When deciding on the position of smoke alarms it is important to remember that they are intended to detect smoke before it reaches the sleeping occupants of a building.  The ensuing alarm is designed to wake the occupants and give them time to evacuate the building.  Explanatory Information: Smoke alarms required on other storeys not containing bedrooms  In addition to a smoke alarm being required to be provided on storeys containing bedrooms, a smoke alarm is also required on each other storey that is not already provided with a smoke alarm even if those storeys consist of only carparking, bathrooms, laundries and the like. “Storey” in this context differs from the definition contained in the NCC which excludes such spaces from being considered as storeys.  Reference to “storey” only applies within a single dwelling. For example, if a storey contains a private garage belonging to the Class 1a dwelling in addition to a private garagewhich does not belong to the Class 1a dwelling, smoke alarms must be installed in both private garages.  Where the other storey is a Class 10a private garage, clause 9.5.1(b) of the ABCB Housing Provisions permits the use of any other alarm deemed suitable in accordance with AS 1670.1 provided smoke alarms complying with AS 3786 are installed elsewhere in the Class 1 building.  Explanatory Information: Nuisance alarms  Smoke alarms are extremely sensitive and may detect smoke and moisture created by common household activities such as burnt toast or steam from a bathroom.  Accordingly, to reduce the likelihood of nuisance alarms, it is preferable that smoke alarms are not located near cooking appliances and bathrooms. However, if it is necessary to locate alarms in these positions, the type of alarm installed may need to be considered as some alarm types may be more suitable in certain locations.  Explanatory Information: Added flexibility when considering smoke alarm location  The options described in the ABCB Housing Provisions are not the only means available for complying with this Part. The performance-based nature of the NCC provides flexibility to develop alternative methods if it is preferred to meet the Performance Requirement in some other way. This added flexibility may be utilised when considering the location of smoke alarms.  Introduction to this Part  This Part is intended to address several factors which impact on health and amenity. These factors include, waterproofing of wet areas, room heights, kitchen, laundry and toilet facilities, lighting, ventilation, sound insulation and condensation.","Performance Requirement H3P2 and the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions of Part 9.5 of the ABCB Housing Provisions require automaticwarning on the detection of smoke in buildings, so that occupants may be alerted to a fire in order to evacuate to a place of safety.

For example, if a storey contains a private garage belonging to the Class 1a dwelling in addition to a private garagewhich does not belong to the Class 1a dwelling, smoke alarms must be installed in both private garages.  Where the other storey is a Class 10a private garage, clause 9.5.1(b) of the ABCB Housing Provisions permits the use of any other alarm deemed suitable in accordance with AS 1670.1 provided smoke alarms complying with AS 3786 are installed elsewhere in the Class 1 building.  Explanatory Information: Nuisance alarms  Smoke alarms are extremely sensitive and may detect smoke and moisture created by common household activities such as burnt toast or steam from a bathroom.  Accordingly, to reduce the likelihood of nuisance alarms, it is preferable that smoke alarms are not located near cooking appliances and bathrooms. However, if it is necessary to locate alarms in these positions, the type of alarm installed may need to be considered as some alarm types may be more suitable in certain locations.  Explanatory Information: Added flexibility when considering smoke alarm location  The options described in the ABCB Housing Provisions are not the only means available for complying with this Part. The performance-based nature of the NCC provides flexibility to develop alternative methods if it is preferred to meet the Performance Requirement in some other way. This added flexibility may be utilised when considering the location of smoke alarms.  Introduction to this Part  This Part is intended to address several factors which impact on health and amenity. These factors include, waterproofing of wet areas, room heights, kitchen, laundry and toilet facilities, lighting, ventilation, sound insulation and condensation.","","","","","","","",H3P2,"","","","","","",Energy,"","","",V2,"","","","","","","","","",H,H3,true

H4V1 is a means to verify that the height of a room or space is suitable for the intended use, and therefore meets the requirement of H4P2.  In relation to the intended function of a room or space, the activities that are likely to be undertaken by occupants in the room of space, as well the features of the activities, are relevant considerations when determining a suitable height. For example, if the intended use of a room is a gymnasium, then gymnastic activities are likely to be undertaken in the room. These activities often involve jumps and flips which require significant space in order to be undertaken safely.  In terms of the occupants, their features and needs are also relevant when determining a suitable height. For example, occupant features and needs would differ between rooms or spaces intended as a child’s play area, and rooms or spaces intended for adult’s indoor cricket.  The method requires consideration of ‘activity traits’, ‘occupant traits’ and ‘activity support level’. Refer to Schedule 1 for more information on these terms.  When determining the activity support level, the method requires consideration of the relevant dimensions of items likely to be located in the room or space, as well as occupant circulation spaces.  Some of these considerations are—  •   stairs and ramps, since the height of the room of the space will change relative to the occupant during incline and decline; and  •   fixed fittings such as lights that may protrude from the ceiling and wash-basins; and  •   domestic services such as air-conditioners, heaters, ceiling fans and heated water systems; and  •   fixed equipment such manufacturing or processing equipment, permanent signage or displays and lifts; and  •   moveable equipment such as whitegoods; and  •   fixed furniture such as built-in wardrobes and permanent seating; and  •   moveable furniture such as wardrobes, desks and beds; and  •   occupant circulation spaces so that occupants can move comfortably and safety around the room or space.  For example, the location and dimensions of a wash-basin is a relevant consideration in determining the activity support level of a bathroom. This is because an occupant will typically need to access the wash-basin whilst standing, which  will influence the necessary height of the space.  Another example is the consideration of moveable equipment such as a refrigerator in a kitchen. If the intended use of a space is a kitchen, then it would be unrealistic to determine a sufficient height for the room without considering the height of a typical refrigerator that would be located in the room.","The intent of H4P2 is the height of a room or space is sufficient for the intended use of the room or space. ‘Intended use’ recognises that the height required in a room or space is directly related to the room or space’s intended function.

Explanatory Information  Alpine areas are located in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.  Alpine areas are areas 1200 m or more above Australian Height Datum (AHD) for New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, and 900 m or more above AHD for Tasmania, as shown in Figure 1.  Alpine areas are considered to receive significant snowfalls (snowfalls that result in an average snow accumulation on  the ground of 175 mm or greater). Regions in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria between 600    1200 m AHD are considered to be sub-alpine areas and may receive significant snowfalls, however unlike alpine areas the snow is unlikely to accumulate.  It is recommended that the appropriate authority be consulted to determine whether the building is located in an alpine area. AS/NZS 1170.3 also contains further detail in the identification of alpine areas and the altitude of the alpine regions of Australia.  In the Australian Capital Territory, Canberra is not designated as an alpine area as snow loads are not considered significant.  Alteration: In relation to a building, includes an addition or extension to a building.  Aluminium Composite Panel(ACP): Flat or profiled aluminium sheet material in composite with any type of materials. Amenity: An attribute which contributes to the health, physical independence, comfort and well-being of people.  Ancillary element: An element that is secondary to and not an integral part of another element to which it is attached.  Annual exceedance probability: The probability that a given rainfall total accumulated over a given duration will be exceeded in any one year.  Annual greenhouse gas emissions: The theoretical amount of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the energy used annually by a building s services, excluding kitchen exhaust and the like.

The requirements of AS 1926.3 apply to all types of pools defined as swimming pools under the NCC, irrespective of the definition in the Standard.  Explanatory Information  Water recirculation systems  The swimming poolwater recirculation system requirements seek to minimise the risk of entrapment or injury of people using the swimming pool and provide for the safe operation of skimmer boxes and outlet systems.  Explanatory Information  Additional requirements  In addition to the requirements of this Part, a swimming pool must comply with the structural requirements of other Parts of NCC Volume Two and the ABCB Housing Provisions. The structural requirements refer to the swimming pool being designed and constructed to withstand any combinations of loads and other actions to which it may reasonably be subjected and the structural resistance of the materials and forms of construction used in the swimming pool.
